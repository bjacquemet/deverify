    <p>Deverify was a service that helped companies easily assess Rails developers' skills during the recruiting process. ðŸš€<br>
    Candidates had to solve tickets on real applications, in a Gitlab environment.
    After reviewing the code, we were providing a report for the company to take its decision with objective data.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, we won't provide the service anymore. ðŸ˜ž</p>

    <p>Thanks again to all our partners and clients who trusted us and helped us grow the business. ðŸ˜˜ ðŸ˜˜</p>
